Case Study: Book and Author Management System
Objective: Create a microservices-based application with two services: BookService and AuthorService. The BookService will use OpenFeign to interact with the AuthorService to retrieve author information for books.

Overview

**BookService**: Manages book information and retrieves author details from AuthorService using OpenFeign.
**AuthorService**: Provides author details.
Architecture
BookService

Endpoints:
    /books: Retrieve a list of all books.
    /books/{id}: Retrieve details of a specific book, including author information.
AuthorService

Endpoints:
    /authors: Retrieve a list of all authors.
    /authors/{id}: Retrieve details of a specific author.
Step-by-Step Implementation
Set Up the Projects
Create a Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr for both BookService and AuthorService. Include the following dependencies:

Spring Web
Lombok
OpenFeign (Needed only for BookService)
Implement the AuthorService
Author model class for AuthorService:

public class Author {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    // Getters and setters
}
AuthorRepository for AuthorService:

@Repository
public class AuthorRepository {

    private List<Author> authors = new ArrayList<>();

    public AuthorRepository() {
        authors.add(new Author(1L, "George Orwell"));
        authors.add(new Author(2L, "J.K. Rowling"));
        authors.add(new Author(3L, "Harper Lee"));
        authors.add(new Author(4L, "J.R.R. Tolkien"));
        authors.add(new Author(5L, "Jane Austen"));
    }

    public List<Author> findAll() {
    }

    public Author findById(Long id) {
    }
}
AuthorController for AuthorService:

@RestController
public class AuthorController {

    @Autowired
    private AuthorRepository authorRepository;

    @GetMapping("/authors")
    public List<Author> getAllAuthors() {
        return authorRepository.findAll();
    }

    @GetMapping("/authors/{id}")
    public Author getAuthorById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return authorRepository.findById(id);
    }
}
Implement the BookService
Book model class for BookService:

public class Book {
    private Long id;
    private String title;
    private Long authorId;
    // Getters and setters
}
BookRepository for BookService:

@Repository
public class BookRepository {

    private List<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();

    public BookRepository() {
        books.add(new Book(1L, "1984", 1L));
        books.add(new Book(2L, "Harry Potter", 2L));
        books.add(new Book(3L, "To Kill a Mockingbird", 3L));
        books.add(new Book(4L, "The Lord of the Rings", 4L));
        books.add(new Book(5L, "Pride and Prejudice", 5L));
    }

    public List<Book> findAll() {
    }

    public Book findById(Long id) {
    }
}
BookController for BookService:

@RestController
public class BookController {

    @Autowired
    private BookRepository bookRepository;

    @Autowired
    private AuthorClient authorClient;

    @GetMapping("/books")
    public List<BookDTO> getAllBooks() {
    }

    @GetMapping("/books/{id}")
    public BookDTO getBookById(@PathVariable Long id) {
    }
}
BookDTO class for BookService:

public class BookDTO {
    private Long id;
    private String title;
    private Author author;
    // Getters and setters
}
Implement the AuthorClient
AuthorClient will use OpenFeign to interact with the AuthorService:

public interface AuthorClient {
    public Author getAuthorById(@PathVariable Long id);
}
